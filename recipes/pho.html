    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pho originated in the early 20th century in northern Vietnam, and was popularized throughout the world by refugees after the Vietnam War. Because pho's origins are poorly documented,[8][9] there is disagreement over the cultural influences that led to its development in Vietnam, as well as the etymology of the name.[10] The Hanoi (northern) and Saigon (southern) styles of pho differ by noodle width, sweetness of broth, and choice of herbs.</p>
